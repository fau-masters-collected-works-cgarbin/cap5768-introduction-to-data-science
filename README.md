CAP5768 Introduction to Data Science Fall 2019

## Assignment 1

[Assignment](./assignment1) 1 is a warm-up exercise, to get used to NumPy and Pandas in Jupyter environment.

Covered in this assignment:

* Get a Jupyter Lab environment up and running (see [this wiki page](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin/cap5768-introduction-to-data-science/wiki/Minimalist-JupyterLab-setup-with-a-handful-of-extensions))
* Learn and apply NumPy and Pandas (see notes [in this wiki page](https://github.com/fau-masters-collected-works-cgarbin/cap5768-introduction-to-data-science/wiki/Notes-from-Python-Data-Science-Handbook))
* Read data from .csv files
* Uses Pandas `DataFrame` and `Series` filter and aggregration functions
* Find correlations analytically with Pearson correlation coefficient and aggregated statistics
* Find correlations with graphs (Seaborn `regplot`)
* Formulate and verify hypothesis with analytical (e.g. aggregation by type) and graphical support (e.g. box plots)
